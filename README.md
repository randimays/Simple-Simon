# Simple Simon Game

Basic Simple Simon is a game with 4 colors that play randomly and continue to add one color to the sequence at each turn. You must then select the correct order back to the game for as many rounds as you can. 

The player must repeat the sequences played on any of 6 Archer character photos correctly in order to achieve the high score! The speed at which the sequence is repeated to the player is increased at each new level, and the high score is tracked at the end of each game. The game resets with the first incorrect input from the player. The game will end automatically after 50 rounds of correct player guesses.
